Mentor/Mentee Matching Scripts
==============================

Simple script to randomly match mentors and mentees. 

Inputs:

- mentor1.csv - list of mentors that will take up to one mentee
- mentor2.csv - list of mentors that will take up to two  mentee
- students.csv - list of students


Outputs:

- mentor_match.csv - list of mentors and their one or two mentees
- student_match.csv - list of students and their mentor


Generally I kept pruning the mentor lists for mentors that didn't
get enough students as more students wanted a mentor.
